Pathfinder Networking Website:

As a Pathfinder Alumni, I want a proper networking site so that I can further my business working with people I can relate to, socially and as far as work ethic. I would want a standard profile, similar to that of a Facebook or LinkedIn.

Profile:

- Inset picture
- Name
- Current Job/Company
- Location
- E-mail
- Years at Pathfinder
- Positions held while at Pathfinder

There should also be a homepage where I can post prospective job offers or that I
am seeking employment.

- Perhaps a tags feature could be included…where profiles have certain tags ex. Engineer and the person posting a job offer on the homepage would tag “Engineer” if seeking someone in that role.
- All people on the platform are automatically ‘friends’ so all profiles can be viewed and any posts on the ‘homepage’ will be viewable by all on the platform.
- Homepage should also be able to support videos and photo albums so that
people can give a better picture of the company they run or work they’re
currently involved with.

Private Inboxes should be a feature so that there is a convenient way to communicate between parties, aside from e-mail.

We can get into how we want to style site but we will want to give it a ‘camp feel’

- Using red canoes as ‘profile’ and ‘homepage’ buttons.
- Stencil font for the main headers
- Changing names like ‘homepage’ to the ‘bulletin board’ etc.
- Camp themes will be integral in the design.
